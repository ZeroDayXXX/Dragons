💡 The Problem

Training centers still manage payments manually:

Sales managers call students one-by-one before deadlines

Payments are missed or delayed due to lack of reminders

Leaders can’t instantly see who paid / who is overdue / who paid partially

Receipts are scattered across chats and messages → no audit trail

Result: lost time, lower cashflow predictability, and operational chaos.

✅ How We Solve It

This project turns payment tracking into an automated workflow — all inside one dashboard.

🚀 Core Idea

We convert every student’s payment obligation into a structured schedule with clear statuses:

Paid ✅

Overdue 🔴

Partial 🟠

(Optional: Due Soon) ⏳

Then the system automates the boring parts:

deadline calculation

reminders

receipt collection & verification

reports for management

🔁 Payment Automation Flow

End-to-end process (no calls needed):

Student joins a group → payment plan is created

System generates upcoming payment schedule (monthly / package)

Before due date → automated reminders are sent (e.g., 5–3–1 days)

If late → status becomes Overdue + escalation reminders

Student uploads receipt → manager verifies → payment becomes Paid

Management sees real-time analytics & performance by group and staff

🧠 What Makes It Different
🎯 Built for training centers (not generic invoicing)

Filters by Group → Student → Payment Status

Clear operational statuses (Paid / Overdue / Partial)

Built-in receipt verification workflow

Date range views for payment reporting (due date vs payment date)

📊 Real-time visibility for leaders

Who is close to deadline?

Which groups have the most overdue payments?

Which staff member handles the most delayed accounts?
